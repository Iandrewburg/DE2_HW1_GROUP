# Data Engineering 2: Encrypted Message Assignment 1

**TEAM MEMBERS**: Arbash, Ian, and Marcell

**CEU is reprented by Ian**

## Process
In this project, we have three folders, representing Marcell, Arbash, and CEU. The project was completed entirely in codespaces, where we can access each other's public keys easily. 
The visitors send a message to CEU here, and CEU decrypts the message and sends a message back using the public key of the individual.
