# Data Engineering 2: Encrypted Message Assignment 1

**TEAM MEMBERS**: Arbash, Ian, and Marcell

**CEU is reprented by Ian**

## Process
In this project, we have three folders, representing Marcell, Arbash, and CEU. The project was completed entirely in codespaces, where we can access each other's public keys easily. 

The visitors send a message to CEU using CEU's public key, and CEU decrypts the message using the CEU private key. In response, CEU sends a message back using the public key of the individual. 

Instead of sending the public keys and messages via email, this project employs the use of Cloud Computing with CodeSpaces. Everything is completed in CodeSpaces by referencing the CEU and visitor folders.
